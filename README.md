# coreui
A cross platform user interface library built on the new open sourced cross platform .Net Core.

With Microsoft recently open-sourcing the .Net Framework, they created the .Net Core, a cross platform .Net Framework. One of the major flaws of this framework is that it lacks a cross platform user interface system. coreui aims to fix this by introducing System.UserInterface for cross platform user interface development.

This is a community driven project.

ANYONE is welcome :)
